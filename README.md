If you have no coding experince heres a quick guide.
When you are changing the color of the Div class all you do is, ```<div class = "pink">``` and change the pink to whatever you want.
When you want more lines boxes to put whatever you want in it just copy and paste the div class.
it would look something like this
```<div class = "crimson">
            <h1>Put whatever you need here<h1>
            <p>Put whatever you need here</p>
            <div class = "img1">
                <img src = "Putimglinkhere">
            </div>
  <div class = "yellow">
            <h1>Put whatever you need here<h1>
            <p>Put whatever you need here</p>
            <div class = "img1">
                <img src = "Putimglinkhere">
            </div>
            ```
